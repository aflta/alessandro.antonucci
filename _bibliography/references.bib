	Abstract = {We propose temporal word embeddings as a suitable tool to study the evolution of characters and their sentiments across the plot of a narrative text. The dynamic evolution of instances within a narrative text is a challenging task, where complex behavioral evolutions and other characteristics specific to the narrative text need to be inferred and interpreted. While starting from an existing approach to the learning of these models, we propose an alternative initialization procedure which seems to be especially suited for the case of narrative text. As a validation benchmark, we use the Harry Potter series of books as a challenging case study for such character trait evolution. A benchmark data set based on temporal word analogies related to the characters in the plot of the series is considered. The results are promising, and the empirical validation seems to support the working ideas behind this proposal.},

	Abstract = {We focus on the problem of modeling deterministic equations over continuous variables in discrete Bayesian networks. This is typically achieved by a discretisation of both input and output variables and a degenerate quantification of the corre- sponding conditional probability tables. This approach, based on classical probabilities, cannot properly model the information loss induced by the discretisation. We show that a reli- able modeling of such epistemic uncertainty can be instead achieved by credal sets, i.e., convex sets of probability mass functions. This transforms the original Bayesian network in a credal network, possibly returning interval-valued inferences, that are robust with respect to the information loss induced by the discretisation. Algorithmic strategies for an optimal choice of the discretisation bins are also discussed.},

This allows for a compact representation of joint mass functions consistent with logical constraints. We propose a \emph{credal} generalisation of the probabilistic quantification of these models, that allows to replace the local probabilities with (credal) sets of mass functions specified by linear constraints. This induces a joint credal set, that sharply assigns probability zero to states inconsistent with the constraints. These models can support cautious estimates of the local parameters when only small amounts of training data are available. Algorithmic strategies to compute lower and upper bounds of marginal and conditional queries are provided.

A credal semantics involving multiple joint probability mass functions over the possible worlds is adopted. This represents a conservative approach to probabilistic logic programming achieved by considering all the mass functions consistent with the probabilistic facts. This allows to model tasks for which independence among some probabilistic choices cannot be assumed, and a specific dependence model cannot be assessed. Preliminary tests on an object ranking application show that, despite the loose underlying assumptions, informative inferences can be extracted.},

	Venue = {Cologne, Germany},
	abstract = {A machine learning approach to the creation of visual summaries for narrative text is presented. Standard natural language processing tools for named entities recognition are used together with a clustering algorithm to detect the characters of the novel and their aliases. The most relevant ones and their relations are evaluated on the basis of a simple statistical analysis. These characters are visually depicted as nodes of an undirected graph whose edges describe relations with other characters. Specialized sentiment analysis techniques based on sentence embedding decide the colours of characters/nodes and their relations/edges. Additional information about the characters (e.g., gender) and their relations (e.g., siblings or partnerships) are returned by binary classifiers and visually depicted in the graph. For those specialized tasks, small amounts of manually annotated data are sufficient to achieve good accuracy. Compared to analogous tools, the machine learning approach we present allows for a richer representation of texts of this kind. A case study to demonstrate this approach for a series of books is also reported.},

	Abstract = {Influence diagrams are probabilistic graphical models used to represent and solve sequential decision problems under uncertainty. Sharp numerical values are required to quantify probabilities and utilities. This might be an issue with real models, whose parameters are typically obtained from expert judgements or partially reliable data. We consider an interval-valued quantification of the parameters to gain realism in the modeling and evaluate the sensitivity of the inferences with respect to perturbations in the sharp values of the parameters. An extension of the classical influence diagrams formalism to support such interval-valued potentials is presented. The variable elimination and arc reversal inference algorithms are generalized to cope with these models. At the price of an outer approximation, the extension keeps the same complexity as with sharp values. Numerical experiments show improved performances with respect to previous methods. As a natural application, we propose these models for practical sensitivity analysis in traditional influence diagrams. The maximum perturbation level on single or multiple parameters preserving the optimal strategy can be computed. This allows the identification of the parameters deserving a more careful elicitation.},

Once the generative processes of gestures have been identified, an observation sequence is usually classified as the gesture having the highest likelihood, thus ignoring possible prior information. In this paper, we consider two potential improvements of such methods: the inclusion of prior information, and the possibility of considering convex sets of probabilities (in the likelihoods and the prior) to infer imprecise, but more reliable, predictions when information is insufficient. We apply the proposed approach to technical gestures, typically characterized by severe class imbalance. By modelling such imbalances as a prior information, we achieve more accurate results, while the imprecise quantification is shown to produce more reliable estimates.},

	Abstract = {Hidden Markov models are popular tools for the modeling of multivariate time series. A set-valued quantification of the parameters might increase realism in the description of non-stationarity. A recent work shows that the computation of the bounds of the likelihood of a sequence with respect to such imprecise quantification can be performed in the same polynomial time of a precise computation with sharp values. This is the basis for a credal classifier of time series. For each training sequence we learn a set-valued model and compute the interval likelihood of the test sequence. The returned classes are those of the models associated to the undominated intervals. The approach is particularly accurate on the instances for which single classes are returned. We therefore apply this method to early classi- fication of streaming data. As soon as the credal classifier returns a single output we assign a class label even if the stream is not terminated. Tests on a speech recognition benchmark suggest that the proposed approach might outperform a thresholding of the precise likelihoods with the classical models.},

	Abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used probabilistic models of sequential data. As with other probabilistic models, they require the specification of local conditional probability distributions, whose assessment can be too difficult and error-prone, especially when data are scarce or costly to acquire. The imprecise HMM (iHMM) generalizes HMMs by allowing the quantification to be done by sets of, instead of single, probability distributions. iHMMs have the ability to suspend judgment when there is not enough statistical evidence, and can serve as a sensitivity analysis tool for standard non-stationary HMMs. In this paper, we consider iHMMs under the strong independence interpretation, for which we develop efficient infer- ence algorithms to address standard HMM usage such as the computation of likelihoods and most probable explanations, as well as performing filter- ing and predictive inference. Experiments with real data show that iHMMs produce more reliable inferences without compromising the computational efficiency.},

Our main contribution is an exact algorithm that can check whether the MAP configuration is robust with respect to given per- turbations. Its complexity is essentially the same as that of obtaining the MAP configuration itself, so it can be promptly used with minimal effort. We use our algorithm to identify the largest global perturbation that does not induce a change in the MAP configuration, and we successfully apply this robustness measure in two practical scenarios: the prediction of facial action units with posed images and the classification of multiple real public data sets. A strong correlation between the proposed robustness measure and accuracy is verified in both scenarios.},

Its shortcoming was the high computational complexity of the MAP inference, necessary to identify the most probable joint configuration of all classes. In this work, we switch from the ensemble approach to the single model approach. This allows important computational savings. The reduction of inference times is exponential in the difference between the treewidth of the single model and the number of classes. We adopt moreover a more sophisticated approach for the structural learning of the class subgraph. The proposed single models outperforms alternative approaches for multilabel classification such as binary relevance and ensemble of classifier chains.},

	Volume = {50},
	abstract = {Credal networks are graph-based statistical models whose parameters take values in a set, instead of being sharply specified as in traditional statistical models (e.g., Bayesian networks). The computational complexity of inferences on such models depends on the irrelevance/independence concept adopted. In this paper, we study inferential complexity under the concepts of epistemic irrelevance and strong independence. We show that infer- ences under strong independence are NP-hard even in trees with binary variables except for a single ternary one. We prove that under epistemic irrelevance the polynomial-time complexity of inferences in credal trees is not likely to extend to more general models (e.g., singly connected topologies). These results clearly distinguish networks that admit efficient inferences and those where inferences are most likely hard, and settle several open questions regarding their computational complexity. We show that these results remain valid even if we disallow the use of zero probabilities. We also show that the computation of bounds on the probability of the future state in a hidden Markov model is the same whether we assume epistemic irrelevance or strong independence, and we prove a similar result for inference in naive Bayes structures. These inferential equivalences are important for practitioners, as hidden Markov models and naive Bayes structures are used in real applications of imprecise probability.},

As with other probabilistic graphical models, they require the specification of precise probability values, which can be too restrictive for some domains, espe- cially when data are scarce or costly to acquire. We present a generalized version of HMMs, whose quantification can be done by sets of, instead of single, probability distributions. Our models have the ability to suspend judgment when there is not enough statistical evidence, and can serve as a sensitivity analysis tool for standard non-stationary HMMs. Efficient inference algorithms are developed to address standard HMM usage such as the computation of likelihoods and most probable explanations.

The learning of these models is achieved by coupling the EM algorithm with the imprecise Dirichlet model. In the stationarity limit, each model corresponds to an imprecise mixture of Gaussian densities, this reducing the problem to the classification of static, imprecise-probabilistic, information. Two classifiers, one based on the expected value of the mixture, the other on the Bhattacharyya distance between pairs of mixtures, are developed. The computation of the bounds of these descriptors with respect to the imprecise quantification of the parameters is reduced to, respectively, linear and quadratic optimization tasks, and hence efficiently solved.

This assumption allows us to optimally identify the correlations between classes and features; such correlations are moreover shared across all models of the ensemble. Inferences are drawn from the ensemble via logarithmic opinion pooling. To minimize Hamming loss, we compute the marginal probability of the classes by running standard inference on each Bayesian network in the ensemble, and then pooling the inferences. To instead minimize the subset 0/1 loss, we pool the joint distributions of each model and cast the problem as a MAP inference in the corresponding graphical model.

	Abstract = {Credal networks are probabilistic graphical models that extend Bayesian
	nets to deal with imprecision in probability, and can actually be
	regarded as sets of Bayesian nets. Credal nets appear to be powerful
	means to represent and deal with many important and challenging problems
	in uncertain reasoning. The counterpart of having more freedom in
	the modeling phase is an increased inferential complexity of inferences,
	e.g., the so-called belief updating becomes a hard task even on relatively
	simple topologies. In this thesis, I start my investigation on credal
	networks by considering equivalent representations of those models.
	More specifically, I first deliver a new graphical language, which
	is called decision-theoretic being inspired by the formalism of decision
	graphs, for a unified representation of credal networks of any kind.
	I also present another representation, which is called binarization,
	being in fact a reformulation of a credal network solely based on
	binary variables. Remarkably, I prove that if a credal net is first
	reformulated by its decision-theoretic representation and then by
	the corresponding binarization, the resulting representation is completely
	equivalent. An equivalence relation between Bayesian and credal nets,
	when the reason for the missingness of some of the variables in the
	Bayesian nets is unknown, is also provided. The developed equivalent
	representations are applied to inference problems. First, I show
	that, by a decision-theoretic formulation, the algorithms that have
	been already designed for credal networks, which are mostly referred
	to a specific class of models, called separately specified nets,
	can be generalized to credal networks of any kind. Similar formalisms
	are also employed to solve inference and classification problems
	with missing observations. I also present a state-ofthe- art updating
	algorithm which is based on the equivalent binary representation.
	This algorithm, called GL2U, offers an efficient procedure for approximate
	updating of general credal nets. The quality of the overall approximation
	is investigated by promising numerical experiments. As a further
	theoretical investigation, I consider a classification problem for
	Bayesian networks for which a hardness proof together with a fast
	algorithm for a subclass of models is provided. Finally, two real-world
	applications of credal networks are presented. First, I consider
	a military identification problem, consisting in the detection of
	the goal of an intruder entering a no-fly area. The problem, together
	with the necessary fusion of the information gathered by the sensors
	is mapped by our techniques into a credal network updating task.
	The solution is then obtained by the GL2U algorithm. The second application
	is an environmental model for hazard assessment of debris flows by
	credal networks. A credal network evaluates the level of risk, corresponding
	to the observed values of the triggering factors, for this specific
	natural hazard. For some factors, whose observations are more difficult,
	the corresponding soft evidential information is embedded by our
	formalism into the structure of the network. This model is employed
	for extensive numerical analysis on the Swiss territory.},

	Abstract = {Bayesian networks are probabilistic graphical models widely employed
	in AI for the implementation of knowledge-based systems. Standard
	inference algorithms can update the beliefs about a variable of interest
	in the network after the observation of some other variables. This
	is usually achieved under the assumption that the observations could
	reveal the actual states of the variables in a fully reliable way.
	We propose a procedure for a more general modeling of the observations,
	which allows for updating beliefs in different situations, including
	various cases of unreliable, incomplete, uncertain and also missing
	observations. This is achieved by augmenting the original Bayesian
	network with a number of auxiliary variables corresponding to the
	observations. For a flexible modeling of the observational process,
	the quantification of the relations between these auxiliary variables
	and those of the original Bayesian network is done by credal sets,
	i.e., convex sets of probability mass functions. Without any lack
	of generality, we show how this can be done by simply estimating
	the bounds for the likelihoods of the observations. Overall, the
	Bayesian network is transformed into a credal network, for which
	a standard updating problem has to be solved. Finally, a number of
	transformations that might simplify the updating of the resulting
	credal network is provided.},

	Abstract = {According to widely accepted guidelines for self-regulation, the capital

	to three different categories. Among them, operational risk is the
	more difficult to assess, as it requires merging expert judgments
	and quantitative information about the functional structure of the
	bank. A number of approaches to the evaluation of operational risk
	based on Bayesian networks have been recently considered. In this
	paper, we propose credal networks, which are a generalization of
	Bayesian networks to imprecise probabilities, as a more appropriate
	framework for the measurement and management of operational risk.
	The reason is the higher flexibility provided by credal networks
	compared to Bayesian networks in the quantification of the probabilities
	underlying the model: this makes it possible to represent human expertise
	required for these evaluations in a credible and robust way. We use
	a real-world application to demonstrate these features and to show

	theoretical framework of credal networks. Credal networks are a generalization
	of Bayesian networks where credal sets, i.e., closed convex sets
	of probability measures, are used instead of precise probabilities.
	This allows for a more flexible process of elicitation than in the
	case of Bayesian networks. In fact, credal sets allow to represent
	ambiguity, contrast and contradiction in a natural and realistic
	way. The procedure we propose is based on a sharp distinction between
	the domain knowledge and the process linking this knowledge to the
	perceived evidence, which we call the observational process. This
	distinction leads to a very flexible representation of both domain
	knowledge and knowledge about the way the information is collected,
	together with a procedure of aggregation of the information coming
	from the different sources. The overall procedure is illustrated
	along the chapter by a simple knowledge-based system for the prediction
	of the result of a football match.},

	Abstract = {Debris flows represent a very destructive natural hazard, affecting
	buildings, transport infrastructures, and, very often, causing human
	losses in mountain regions. That makes the identification of potential
	source areas of debris flows inside a watershed particularly important.
	In this paper we present a general identification procedure based
	on the credal network (that is an imprecise probabilistic graphical
	model generalizing Bayesian networks) originally introduced by Antonucci
	et al. (2004). That model is significantly improved by a more refined
	description of the meteorological and hydrological processes contributing
	to the debris flow initiation. As a counterpart of such improvement,
	the model pays a slight increase in terms of computational time for
	identifications. That does not prevent its extensive, spatially distributed,
	application to whole basins, thanks to a preliminary deterministic
	analysis that rejects local areas where the triggering of a debris
	flow cannot take place. The overall procedure is tested for a debris
	flow prone watershed in Southern Switzerland. The model detects the
	areas in the basin more prone to debris flow initiation and also
	shows that different rainfall return periods produce different patterns
	of hazard in the basin. That makes it possible with this procedure
	to determine the return period of the critical rainfall that triggers
	debris flow as a result of channel-bed failure in a specific point
	along the drainage network.},
