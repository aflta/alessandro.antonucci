Unsupervised semantic shift tracing, focal point of SemEval2020, is particularly challenging. Given the unsupervised setup, in this work, we propose to identify clusters among different occurrences of each target word, considering these as representatives of different word meanings. As such, disagreements in obtained clusters naturally allow to quantify the level of semantic shift per each target word in four target languages. To leverage this idea, clustering is performed on contextualized (BERT-based) embeddings of word occurrences. The obtained results show that our approach performs well both measured separately (per language) and overall, where we surpass all provided SemEval baselines.</p></details>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="../papers/kanjirangat2020b.pdf">PDF</a>&nbsp;</span></p>

They allow for a compact representation of joint probability mass functions defined over sets of Boolean variables, that are also consistent with the logical constraints defined by the circuit. The probabilities in such a model are usually “learned” from a set of observations. This leads to overconfident and prior-dependent inferences when data are scarce, unreliable or conflicting. In this work, we develop the credal sentential decision diagrams, a generalisation of their probabilistic counterpart that allows for replacing the local probabilities with (so-called credal) sets of mass functions. These models induce a joint credal set over the set of Boolean variables, that sharply assigns probability zero to states inconsistent with the logical constraints. Three inference algorithms are derived for these models. These allow to compute: (i) the lower and upper probabilities of an observation for an arbitrary number of variables; (ii) the lower and upper conditional probabilities for the state of a single variable given an observation; (iii) whether or not all the probabilistic sentential decision diagrams compatible with the credal specification have the same most probable explanation of a given set of variables given an observation of the other variables. These inferences are tractable, as all the three algorithms, based on bottom-up traversal with local linear programming tasks on the disjunctive gates, can be solved in polynomial time with respect to the circuit size. The first algorithm is always exact, while the remaining two might induce a conservative (outer) approximation in the case of multiply connected circuits. A semantics for this approximation together with an auxiliary algorithm able to decide whether or not the result is exact is also provided together with a brute-force characterization of the exact inference in these cases. For a first empirical validation, we consider a simple application based on noisy seven-segment display images. The credal models are observed to properly distinguish between easy and hard-to-detect instances and outperform other generative models not able to cope with logical constraints.</p></details>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="../papers/mattei2020a.pdf">PDF</a>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijar.2020.06.005">DOI</a>&nbsp;</span></p>

Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams (PSDDs) are a subclass of probabilistic circuits able to embed logical constraints to the circuit’s structure. In doing so, they obtain extra expressiveness with empirical optimal performance. Despite achieving competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art competitors, there have been very few attempts at learning PSDDs from a combination of both data and knowledge in the form of logical formulae. Our work investigates sampling random PSDDs consistent with domain knowledge and evaluating against state-of-the-art probabilistic models. We propose a method of sampling that retains important structural constraints on the circuit’s graph that guarantee query tractability. Finally, we show that these samples are able to achieve competitive performance even on larger domains.</p></details>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="../papers/geh2020a.pdf">PDF</a>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="http://doi.org/10.5753/kdmile.2020.11968">DOI</a>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/kdmile/article/view/11968">URL</a>&nbsp;</span></p>

We show that endogenous observations induce linear constraints on the probabilities of the exogenous variables. This allows to exactly map a causal model into a credal network. Causal inferences, such as interventions and counterfactuals, can consequently be obtained by standard algorithms for the updating of credal nets. These natively return sharp values in the identifiable case, while intervals corresponding to the exact bounds are produced for unidentifiable queries. A characterization of the causal models that allow the map above to be compactly derived is given, along with a discussion about the scalability for general models. This contribution should be regarded as a systematic approach to represent structural causal models by credal networks and hence to systematically compute causal inferences. A number of demonstrative examples is presented to clarify our methodology. Extensive experiments show that approximate algorithms for credal networks can immediately be used to do causal inference in real-size problems.</p></details>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="../papers/zaffalon2020a.pdf">PDF</a>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="https://pgm2020.cs.aau.dk">URL</a>&nbsp;</span></p>

These models are analogous to Bayesian networks, but their local parameters are only con- strained to vary in, so-called credal, sets. Inference in credal networks is intended as the com- putation of the bounds of a query with respect to those local variations. For credal networks the task is harder than in Bayesian networks, being NPPP-hard in general models. Yet, scalable approximate algorithms have been shown to provide good accuracies on large or dense mod- els, while exact techniques can be designed to process small or sparse models. CREMA embeds these algorithms and also offers an API to build and query credal networks together with a spec- ification format. This makes CREMA, whose features are discussed and described by a simple example, the most advanced tool for credal network modelling and inference developed so far.</p></details>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="../papers/huber2020a.pdf">PDF</a>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="https://pgm2020.cs.aau.dk">URL</a>&nbsp;</span></p>

Credal networks are an extension of Bayesian networks where local probability mass functions are only constrained to belong to given, so-called credal, sets. CREDICI is based on the recent work of Zaffalon et al. (2020), where an equivalence between Pearl’s structural causal models and credal networks has been derived. This allows to reduce a counterfactual query in a causal model to a standard query in a credal network, even in the case of unidentifiable causal effects. The necessary transformations and data structures are implemented in CREDICI, while inferences are eventually computed by CREMA (Huber et al., 2020), a twin library for general credal network inference.

</pre></details>&nbsp;<details><summary>ABS</summary><p class="abstract">There exists a dichotomy between classical probabilistic graphical models, such as Bayesian net- works (BNs), and modern tractable models, such as sum-product networks (SPNs). The former generally have intractable inference, but provide a high level of interpretability, while the latter admit a wide range of tractable inference routines, but are typically harder to interpret. Due to this dichotomy, tools to convert between BNs and SPNs are desirable. While one direction – compiling BNs into SPNs – is well discussed in Darwiche’s seminal work on arithmetic circuit compilation, the converse direction – decompiling SPNs into BNs – has received surprisingly little attention. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing SPN2BN, an algorithm that decompiles an SPN into a BN. SPN2BN has several salient features when compared to the only other two works decompiling SPNs. Most significantly, the BNs returned by SPN2BN are minimal independence-maps that are more parsimonious with respect to the introduction of latent variables. Secondly, the output BN produced by SPN2BN can be precisely characterized with respect to a compiled BN. More specifically, a certain set of directed edges will be added to the input BN, giving what we will call the moral-closure. Lastly, it is established that our compilation-decompilation process is idempotent. This has practical significance as it limits the size of the decompiled SPN.</p></details>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="../papers/maua2020a.pdf">PDF</a>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="https://pgm2020.cs.aau.dk">URL</a>&nbsp;</span></p>

Marginal information gain is used to decide the variables to be explained first, and their most probable marginal states are consequently moved to the evidence. The sequential iteration of this procedure leads to a MMAP explanation and the minimum information gain obtained during the process can be regarded as a confidence measure for the explanation. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed confidence measure is properly detecting instances for which the algorithm is accurate and, for sufficiently high confidence levels, the algorithm gives the exact solution or an approximation whose Hamming distance from the exact one is small.</p></details>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="../papers/antonucci2020a.pdf">PDF</a>&nbsp;</span></p>

After any interaction with the user, a probability mass function over the items is updated by the system. The conversational feature corresponds to a sequential discovery of the user preferences based on questions. Information-theoretic criteria are used to optimally shape the interactions and decide when the conversation ends. Most probable items are consequently recommended. Dedicated elicitation techniques for the prior probabilities of the parameters modelling the interactions are derived from basic structural judgements based on logical compatibility and symmetry assumptions. Such prior knowledge is combined with data for better item discrimination. Our Bayesian approach is validated against matrix factorization techniques for cold-start recommendations based on metadata using the popular benchmark data set MovieLens. Results show that the proposed approach allows to considerably reduce the number of interactions while maintaining good ranking performance.</p></details>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="../papers/mangili2020b.pdf">PDF</a>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="https://sites.google.com/view/wicrs2020">URL</a>&nbsp;</span></p>

The dynamic evolution of instances within a narrative text is a challenging task, where complex behavioral evolutions and other characteristics specific to the narrative text need to be inferred and interpreted. While starting from an existing approach to the learning of these models, we propose an alternative initialization procedure which seems to be especially suited for the case of narrative text. As a validation benchmark, we use the Harry Potter series of books as a challenging case study for such character trait evolution. A benchmark data set based on temporal word analogies related to the characters in the plot of the series is considered. The results are promising, and the empirical validation seems to support the working ideas behind this proposal.</p></details>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="../papers/volpetti2020a.pdf">PDF</a>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="http://doi.org/10.1145/3383972.3383988">DOI</a>&nbsp;</span></p>

</pre></details>&nbsp;<details><summary>ABS</summary><p class="abstract">We present a Bayesian approach to conversational recom- mender systems. After any interaction with the user, a probability mass function over the items is updated by the system. The conversational feature corresponds to a sequential discovery of the user preferences based on questions. Information-theoretic criteria are used to optimally shape the interactions and decide when the conversation ends. Most probable items are consequently recommended. Dedicated elicitation techniques for the prior probabilities of the parameters modelling the interactions are derived from basic structural judgements based on logical compatibility and symmetry assumptions. Such prior knowledge is combined with data for better item discrimination. Our Bayesian approach is validated against matrix factorization techniques for cold-start recommendations based on metadata using the popular benchmark data set MovieLens. Results show that the proposed approach allows to considerably reduce the number of interactions while maintaining good ranking performance.</p></details>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="../papers/mangili2020a.pdf">PDF</a>&nbsp;<a class="mytags" href="http://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58449-8_14">DOI</a>&nbsp;</span></p>
